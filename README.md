Hi! I'm  [ðŸ…±ðŸ…»ðŸ…°ðŸ†€](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chinonsoodiaka/).

This is my submission for the ```Agentscraft Hackathon``` 2024.


A few things you should know...

* This solution is an agentic chatbot with integrated image generation capabilities, designed to provide a rich, interactive experience. The workflow leverages ```LangGraph``` components, along with ```Tavily``` and a ```Gradio tool```, creating a seamless system for user interactions.

* The best part? This system operates at ```zero``` cost â€” no additional expenses required. However, to unlock its full potential, you'll need a few API keys to enable all features.

* One of the key advantages of this setup is its flexibility. The theme or use case of this chatbot can be effortlessly customized. While it's currently focused on ```Heritage``` you could easily adapt it to something entirely different â€” like "Space" â€” as long as you have a knowledge base that supports the new theme. Each component is modular and can be swapped out for alternatives without disrupting the overall structure.

## Introduction

### 1. Project Background:

* Heritage is an innovative AI initiative aimed at making the rich, diverse culture and pre-historic art of Nigeria accessible and interactive.
* Leveraging Generative AI, Heritage seeks to address the need for quick, intuitive access to Nigerian cultural information, including visual descriptions of art styles, traditions, and historical significance.

### 2. Purpose:

* To create an immersive AI query system that enables usersâ€”both Nigerian culture enthusiasts and curious global audiencesâ€”to explore and learn about Nigerian heritage in an engaging way.
* By providing textual and visual descriptions, this system goes beyond static information, encouraging users to explore with ```imagination and curiosity```.

 ## Hackathon Goals

In Partnership with TensorOps & DiamantAI:

* Heritage will be developed as part of the TensorOps hackathon, which emphasizes innovation in AI agents. This project aligns perfectly with the hackathonâ€™s theme by ```creating an interactive cultural guide agent```.
* As part of this hackathon, Heritage aims to become a contributor to the GenAI-Agents repository, showcasing Nigeria's history and culture through generative AI.

## Project Overview

Key Features:

* Natural Language Query Handling: Users can ask questions about Nigerian history, ethnic groups, art styles, and traditions, receiving informative, AI-generated responses.
* Visual Descriptions of Art: With the aid of AI, Heritage will generate rich descriptions and visualizations of Nigerian art forms, helping users imagine these historical pieces.
* Agent Architecture: The Heritage agent will use conversational AI, embeddings, and retrieval mechanisms to answer queries in real-time, facilitating easy access to Nigeriaâ€™s cultural legacy.

## Submission 

Submission Process:

* Following the hackathon guidelines, Heritage will be submitted to the GenAI-Agents repository via a pull request, along with a comprehensive tutorial on the system's setup, structure, and usage.
